# Wilson

Wilson is an application designed to help users create and manage their goals. Each Goal has many tasks and when a user marks all the tasks assigned to that goal off, Wilson recognises that the goal is complete!

# 2.0 Upgrade!

There has been an overwhelming amount of changes since I first deployed this application a few months ago. My continued learning since graduating The Flatiron School Programming Bootcamp has allowed me to become an even better software engineer. I decided that it was due time for the application to be re-imagined from both the Front end and the Back end perspectives. 
    
    - Some of the main upgrades includeâ€¦
        - A full RESTful Rails API Backend.
        - JSON Web Tokens to verify Users and provide a better user experience. 
        - Powerful validations for models that provide errors to the front end.
        - Validations through the model to reject unwanted information.
        - Visualization: developed through a mobile first styling process.
